# CIFERA

A normal encryption algorithm utilizing and combining some current strong algorithms + small stuff to obfuscate it a tiny bit more...
im just.. dumb...

## Traits

- Encrypt and decrypt text files
- CLI
- Easy to use

## Cloning and Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/svetlyi223/cifera.git
cd cifera
```

Make sure you have `make` and `OpenSSL` installed. (Im gonna add the commands later. my ass gon be late for courses😭)

Just run `make`:

```bash
make
```

Create `input.txt` file with message if not yet created (will change so it can be any file later [same with decryption too]).

If you ran make once, you can just directly run the executable next time:
```bash
./cifera
```

These fonts got me crying 😭😭😭
